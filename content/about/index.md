## About Me

Hi, I am William Fan.

I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development (about 80%) and some experience in frontend (20%). Over the years, I’ve worked on large-scale e-commerce and SaaS applications, and right now, I’m helping build a payment system for a leading restaurant reservation company in Japan. I love keeping things structured and organized, but I also exploring new technical fields that enhance my work.

Outside of work, I am up for trying new things—some stick, some don’t, but that’s part of the fun. I’ve explored learning the piano, playing badminton, hiking, staying active at the gym, picking up new languages, reading, joing religious groups, and even working holidays. Just to see what life has to offer.

## Life in Milestones

- Returned to a software engineering career in 2025.
- Spent time in Canada in 2024, gaining new perspectives while exploring my next steps.
- Landed my first job in tech after an internship in 2020.
- Completed my alternative military service in Taiwan (2018-2019).
- Walked the Camino de Santiago for a month in 2017 — an unforgettable experience.
- Took a gap year in Germany as an exchange student in 2016.
- Earned a master’s degree.
- Went to university.

When I think about introducing myself, I always find myself looking back. Not every decision was perfect, and some taught me more than others. Every now and then, I pause, reflect, and let my past guide me. I hope that my next choice leads to something meaningful.
